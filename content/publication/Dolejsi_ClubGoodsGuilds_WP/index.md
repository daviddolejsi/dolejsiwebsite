title: "Market Power in Pre-modern Prague: Club Goods and Rent-seeking"

abstract: "Medieval and early modern craft guilds were rent-seeking coalitions of 
local producers that controlled markets at the expense of society as well as 
market-enhancing organizations that reduced the high transaction costs associated 
with pre-modern industries. This article presents an economic analysis of this 
seemingly contradicting behavior. The proposed argument is simple. Obtaining 
a market privilege guaranteed guild members extra rents while increasing 
the cost of losing membership, which motivated greater collective action within the organization. 
The ability to punish free-riders and enforced cooperation was used to overcome 
the problems brought by the transition from kin to market economy.
