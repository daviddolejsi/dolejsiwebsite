title: "Feudal bargain in Prague: The rise, spread, and fall of craft guilds"

abstract: "The objective of the study was to assess the societal cost of alcohol 
consumption in the Czech Republic in 2016 and open the public debate about alcohol 
harmfulness and its costs. Although alcohol is readily available and widely 
tolerated in the CZ, society is not able to resolve all the negative consequences 
of consumption and fulfill unmet needs in the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients."

summary: Craft guilds were created as a response to certain problems associated with raising royal revenues and securing basic public services in Prague during the medieval and early modern periods. The theory consistent with historical evidence predicts that the rise, spread, and fall of guilds was a result of mutually beneficial bargaining between local craftsmen and their feudal rulers. Guilds enabled craftsmen to utilize the benefits of collusion by offering their capacities to sovereign authorities in exchange for exclusive market privileges. Nevertheless, they created social distortions within their industries in the process.
