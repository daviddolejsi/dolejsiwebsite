title: "Coproduction of property rights: The management of watercourses in pre-modern Bohemia"

abstract: "The structure of ownership is recognized as a key factor for economic and social development. 
The traditional approach suggests that new property rights emerge when it becomes profitable 
to invest in their production. I extend this idea by arguing that simply defining 
new property rules is not enough for new rights to develop effectively, 
and that enforcement of those rules is just as important. Identifying and 
implementing an optimal combination of definition and enforcement activities 
then becomes the central issue in the development of property rights. 
I illustrate the application of this theory with a detailed 
study of the evolution of water rights in pre-modern Bohemia."

summary: Craft guilds were created as a response to certain problems associated with raising royal revenues and securing basic public services in Prague during the medieval and early modern periods. The theory consistent with historical evidence predicts that the rise, spread, and fall of guilds was a result of mutually beneficial bargaining between local craftsmen and their feudal rulers. Guilds enabled craftsmen to utilize the benefits of collusion by offering their capacities to sovereign authorities in exchange for exclusive market privileges. Nevertheless, they created social distortions within their industries in the process.
