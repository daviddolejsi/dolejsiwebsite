consumption in the Czech Republic in 2016 and open the public debate about alcohol 
harmfulness and its costs. Although alcohol is readily available and widely tolerated in the CZ, 
society is not able to resolve all the negative consequences of consumption and 
fulfill unmet needs in the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients."
