abstract: Craft guilds were a response to problems associated with raising royal revenues and securing basic public services in Central Europe during the medieval and early modern periods. The theory consistent with historical evidence predicts that the rise, spread and fall of guilds was a result of mutually beneficial bargaining between local craftsmen and their feudal rulers. Guilds enabled craftsmen to utilize the benefits of collusion by offering their capacities to sovereign authorities in exchange for exclusive market privileges.
