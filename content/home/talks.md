My research philosophy is that good economic history is a combination of extensive knowledge of historical facts with the rigor of rational choice theory. As a result, my research interests are mainly in microeconomic history. In particular, I specialize in microeconomic analysis of historical institutions.

I am currently a Research Fellow at Monetary Research Center of University of National and World Economy in Bulgaria. I hold Ph.D. degree in Comparative Analysis of Institutions, Economics & Law from the University of Turin.

**Fields of research:**
  * Economic history 
  * Microeconomics 
  * Institutional economics 
  * Game theory
  * Industrial organization
