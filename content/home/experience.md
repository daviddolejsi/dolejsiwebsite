My expertise lies primarily in banking and financial regulations, with a specialized focus on two key areas: model risk management and model validation.

In model validation, I concentrate on credit risk models, covering audit, validation processes, and methodological design, while ensuring compliance with regulations such as the ECB Guidelines, Basel II, and IFRS 9.

In the area of model risk, I provide advisory services to clients, offering insights into model risk frameworks, conducting comprehensive market surveys and benchmarks, and contributing to the development of end-to-end technological solutions.

**Key Focus Areas:**
  
* Model Risk Management Design  
* Model Audit  
* Model Validation  
* IFRS 9 & IRB Modelling  
* Fund Transfer Pricing
