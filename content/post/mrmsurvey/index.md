title: PwC Model Risk Management Survey
---
I have co-authored a PwC survey centred around Model Risk Management. The survey was conducted
between September and December 2024. The respondents consisted primarily of 
banks and insurance companies contacted via connections from the PwC internal network. 
We have collected complete answers from 65 respondents from various financial institutions. 
These institutions are geographically distributed, with a significant presence in South America 18 (28%), 
followed by Western Europe 11 (17%), Australia 7 (11%), Central & Eastern Europe 6 (9%), 
Canada 4 (6%) and Middle East 2 (3%). 17 (26%) respondents chose not to disclose their geographical location. 
These organizations were stratified based on various attributes, such as the number of risk-relevant models, 
including institutions with few (0-20) models to those with many (501+) models. 
The survey brings a diversity of collected answers and provides a comprehensive 
view on MRM areas that were the focus of the analysis.
