I am a highly motivated and results-driven economist with a strong educational 
background in theoretical and empirical economics, complemented by invaluable 
experience in research and financial risk management. 
Holding a PhD degree in Law & Economics from the University of Turin, 
I bring a solid academic foundation to my work.

I specialize in banking and financial regulations, 
with a focus on model risk management and model validation. 
My work includes validating credit risk models to meet ECB, Basel II/IV, and IFRS9 standards, 
and advising clients on model risk frameworks, market benchmarks, and tech-driven solutions.
