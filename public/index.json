The theory consistent with historical evidence predicts that the rise, spread, and fall of guilds was a result of mutually beneficial bargaining between local craftsmen and their feudal rulers. Guilds enabled craftsmen to utilize the benefits of collusion by offering their capacities to sovereign authorities in exchange for exclusive market privileges. Nevertheless, they created social distortions within their industries in the process.","tags":["Craft guilds","Collusion","Privileges","Formal institutions","Market distortion"],"title":"Feudal bargain in Prague: The rise, spread, and fall of craft guilds ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Dolejší"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609372800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609372800,"objectID":"b55f2f34ba45e8646ebd7899cd6bbb58","permalink":"https://daviddolejsi.netlify.app/publication/dolejsi_clubgoodsguilds_wp/","publishdate":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dolejsi_clubgoodsguilds_wp/","section":"publication","summary":"Medieval and early modern craft guilds were rent-seeking coalitions of local producers that controlled markets at the expense of society as well as market-enhancing organizations that reduced the high transaction costs associated with pre-modern industries. This article presents an economic analysis of this seemingly contradicting behavior. The proposed argument is simple. Obtaining a market privilege guaranteed guild members extra rents while increasing the cost of losing membership, which motivated greater collective action within the organization. The ability to punish free-riders and enforced cooperation was used to overcome the problems brought by the transition from kin to market economy.","tags":["Craft guilds","Market power","Club goods","Rent-seeking"],"title":"Market Power in Pre-modern Prague: Club Goods and Rent-seeking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katerina Chadimova","Tomas Mlcoch","Tomas Dolezal","David Dolejší","Barbora Hajickova","Martina Mazalova","Klara Lamblova"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"60b18b3cd437d767145848ece0f2a98c","permalink":"https://daviddolejsi.netlify.app/publication/dolejsi_alcohol/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dolejsi_alcohol/","section":"publication","summary":"The objective of the study was to assess the societal cost of alcohol consumption in the Czech Republic in 2016 and open the public debate about alcohol harmfulness and its costs.

The primary objective of these organizations was to protect interests of their members. To achieve this goal, craft guilds engaged in a variety of activities from which obtaining legal monopolies over local production and trade within their crafts was the most important.","tags":["Property rights","Coproduction","Water rights"],"title":"Craft Guilds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Dolejší"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"8f075acba6481727048a62a76dff2205","permalink":"https://daviddolejsi.netlify.app/publication/dolejsi_millers/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dolejsi_millers/","section":"publication","summary":"The structure of ownership is recognized as a key factor for economic and social development. The traditional approach suggests that new property rights emerge when it becomes profitable to invest in their production. I extend this idea by arguing that simply defining new property rules is not enough for new rights to develop effectively, and that enforcement of those rules is just as important. Identifying and implementing an optimal combination of definition and enforcement activities then becomes the central issue in the development of property rights. I illustrate the application of this theory with a detailed study of the evolution of water rights in pre-modern Bohemia.","tags":["Property rights","Coproduction","Water rights"],"title":"Coproduction of property rights: The management of watercourses in pre-modern Bohemia","type":"publication"}]
